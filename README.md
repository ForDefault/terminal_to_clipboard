# terminal_to_clipboard
Copies terminal history to clipboard from the last time "clear" was typed. Helpful for GPT debugging.
 
Just copy this command into terminal. 
Type "clear" and do some commands.
Type "clip" and everything from the "last typed clear" command will be in your clipboard.

The install command just adds this to .bashrc.
